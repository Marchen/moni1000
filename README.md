# moni1000: Manage Monitoring 1000 Data

This is an R package to support creating monitoring 1000 file format from "long" format data.frame.
Currently, only creating tree census data is supported. If you have any request, please feel free to contact me (maybe using the "Issue" is preferable).

## Installation

Currently, only installation from github is supported. Try following one.

```R
# If you don't have 'devtools' package, please install it first.
install.packages("devtools")

# Install package from github.
devtools::install_github("marchen/moni1000")
```
